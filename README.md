# Battleship

CSE202 Course Project where we try to algorithmically solve the classic game of [Battleships](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)>).

## Input constraints

- Total area of ships should not exceed N\*N
- Ships' postions should not exceed the board boundary.
- There exists at least one ship type that has the smallest length and breadth across all ship types.
- No ship should overlap
- Count and number of positions for each ship type should be the same.
